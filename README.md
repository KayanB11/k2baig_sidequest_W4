## Description

This matches the structure of the original blob sketch from Week 2 but moves
details into classes. I used a for loop to add a "level" label at the top of the blob game.

## Learning Goals

Learning Goals:

- Reviewing the use of loops (in this case 'for')
- Reviewing defining a varibale within a loop
- Using a designated varibale as a holder for another variable (instead of writing a speific word in 'text' I defined a variable known as 'word' and put that as the text holder)

## GenAI

GenAI was used in this side quest to help creating the for loop. With that being said, I understand the functionalities of loops and just needed confirmation on how to write a working loop.
